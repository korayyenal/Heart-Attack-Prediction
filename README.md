# Myocardial-Infarction

## Problem Description

Myocardial infarction (MI), also known as heart attack, refers to the death of heart muscle because of lack of oxygen supply. According to statistics, approximately 1.5 million cases of myocardial infarction (MI) occur annually in the United States. The mortality rate of acute myocardial infarction (MI) is 30%. About 50% of the deaths occur before arrival at the hospital and an additional 5-10% of survivors die within the first year after their myocardial infarction (Zafari et al., 2019).

Myocardial Infarction is one of the most challenging and complex problems since the progress of the disease differs in patients. Complications can be observed frequently and in the period of acute and subacute, they cause to worsening of the disease and even death. There are many types of complications. The most commons are cardiogenic shock, heart failure, embolism, arrhythmia, ischemia, cardiac rupture, angina pectoris, pericarditis, Dresslerâ€™s syndrome, and inflammation. The diversity of complications makes it difficult for a specialist to foresee them.

When I look at the guidelines of MI (Collet, J. P. et al., 2020) (Kristensen, S. D. et al, 2018), there is no detailed explanation about the condition of the patient when complications may occur. For this reason, we want to develop an interpretable machine learning algorithm for predicting complications of myocardial infarction. This implementation can help to prevent complications by taking precautions.
